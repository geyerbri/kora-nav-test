Follow the steps below to edit a form. Open your current project (You can find the list of your projects by clicking on the Projects button on the top menu). Scroll and choose the form you would like to edit, then click the button Edit Form Info . This will bring you to the Edit Form page. Here you can edit the Form Name and Description . You also have the option of setting this form as a Preset , which will allow you to apply this forms information and layout structure to a new form. Here you also have the option of editing form permissions. This is where you can add new administrators and users to your form. For more information, visit the Additional Form Administrators Guide and Adding Users to Forms Guide .

In addition to field types, however, there are further customizations to fields that can be made in order to manipulate how data is entered. This documentation will cover how and were to edit your fields, and what options are available during this editing. Editing Fields from the Form Home Page There are a two ways to edit the fields that you've created : from the form page, and within the field page. This section will cover how to edit your fields from the form home . From the form home, open up a field box by pressing the arrow button located in the right of all field boxes. The first field within your form pages should already be open. Once you have opened up a field, there are seven boxes that you are able to check that will give your field certain attributes. Which boxes you check should be automatically saved by Kora. See the section on \"Field Options Descriptions\" below for a better understanding of what these options do. The last option that you are able to take advantage of from the Form Home page is the ability to delete fields. Simply press the red trash can to delete any unwanted fields. You will be asked if you are sure if you want to delete this field. Editing in the Field Options Page You can edit additional information about the field by clicking on the name of the field or the field options button from the Form Home page. There are three sections available to edit from the Field Page : The Field Name , Alternative Name and Description can all be modified from whatever values were put in when creating the field . Clicking on the name of the field or the field options button. Each field type will then have its own specialized set of advanced options available in the next section. Go to the Understanding Field Types documentation to get a better understanding of how these advanced options work. The last section available when editing a form will be the same options available in step 2 of \"Editing Fields from the Form Home Page\". These are seven options which can be checked to give your field certain attributes. See the section on \"Field Options Descriptions\" below for a better understanding of what these options do. Click Update Field at the bottom of the page to save any changes that you've made while editing your fields. If you wish to delete the field, click on the red trash can at the very bottom of the page. You will be asked if you are sure if you want to delete this field. Field Options Descriptions There are seven options which can be edited from both the Form Home page, and the Field Options page. These are labeled as: Required , Searchable , Advanced Searchable , Externally Searchable , Viewable , Viewable in Results , and Externally Viewable . Required : checking the Required option will force anybody creating a record for this form to fill out this field. A value will have to be entered in order for Kora to accept the record, or a new value will have to be entered if a default value is deleted. Searchable : checking the Searchable option will allow Kora to see any data that is entered into this field when conducting any searches . Advanced Searchable : checking the Advanced Searchable * option will allow Kora to search for any data entered into this field when conducting advanced searches. Externally Searchable : checking the Externally Searchable option will allow programs which have access to Kora's API to search for data located within this field in records. This is especially useful when you have a website that you want to be able to pull data from KORA. Viewable : checking the Viewable option will make this field appear when you are creating or viewing a record with this field. This may come in use if you are unsure of a particular field you have created. You may make it unviewable to those creating records until you have time to come back to it in the future. Viewable in Results : Checking this box affects only how the data from this field shows up when browsing or searching records . This option is incredibly useful for managing the readability of your records in Kora. Instead of having 20 fields of data show up for each record you search for, you are able to narrow it down to fields such as name, id, or whatever is useful to you. It is important to note that this option will not affect whether or not this field is searchable, and all fields will be viewable from the full record page. Externally Viewable : checking the Externally Viewable option will allow programs which have access to Kora's API to view the data located within this field in your Kora records.

Creating a field is the first step towards understanding field types. After choosing to create a field and selecting the Field Type drop-down menu, you'll find the field type options available. These options will determine what types of data are entered into a record . The headings below will discuss the field types by their category: text, number, list, data, file and specialty. After selecting your field type, you can click on Show Advanced Field Options . This is where you will be able to view many of the options for customizing your fields discussed below. Text Fields Text field are fields in which you enter text. There are two types of text field: text field and rich text field . Text A text field allows users to enter any plain text into a record. This can include characters, numbers, and symbols from your keyboard. The advanced field options available include: a Default value, a Regex pattern and whether or not to make the field Multilined *. Default : inputting a default value for a text field will create a value that is always present in that field when creating a record. This value can be deleted and replaced, but it will be initially present for every record containing this text field . Regex : A Regex pattern allows you to customize how a text field is searched for within Kora. For instance, if a word has multiple ways of being spelled, you can specify the different ways that a text field may be entered: the regular expression seriali[sz]e matches both \"serialise\" and \"serialize\". There are much more complex regex expressions you can learn how to write, however. Multilined? : The multilined option allows you to enter more than one line of plain text, by clicking the enter button. There is no set limit to the number of lines you can enter, and a scroll bar will appear if the lines appear out of the text field's view. Rich Text A rich text field allows you write text that can be stylized and edited with the CKE editor. There are numerous options available in this editor to manipulate text. Users will be able to italicize, bold, underline, and strikethrough their text. They can also insert tables and images headings, bulleted lists and numbered lists into their text. Users are then able to run spellchecker, insert links and change other aspects of their text. The user guide for the CKE editor can be found here (They do not have a user guide up and running yet) . There are no advanced options available for this field besides the creation of a default value. Default : Default text can be entered into this field. The entered text will always be present in that field when creating a record. This value can be deleted and replaced, but will always be initially present for every record containing this * rich text field*. Number Fields Number fields allow you to enter numbers. Users may enter the numbers manually into this field using a keyboard. alternatively, users are able to use arrow keys or scroll with their mouse wheel to move the number value up or down by 1. There are two types of number fields: integer field and float field . Integer Integer fields take in whole numbers as their values. These are numbers without decimal points, and they can include negative numbers. If you attempt to enter a value that is not a whole number, then the value will not appear in the record. The advanced field options available include: a Default value, a Minimum Value , a Max Value and Unit of Measurement . Default : A default number can be entered into this field. The entered number will always be present in that field when creating a record. This value can be deleted and replaced, but will always be initially present for every record containing this integer field . Minimum Value : This specifies the lowest value that can be entered for this field. If a value is entered that is lower than this minimum value, Kora will not accept the minimum value. The record will either not be created, or it will shift to the minimum value. If a user is utilizing arrows or a mouse wheel, the value will stop changing at the specified minimum value. Max Value : This specifies the highest value that can be entered for this field. If a value is entered that is higher than this Max value, Kora will not accept the maximum value. The record will either not be created, or shift to the maximum value. If a user is utilizing arrows or a mouse wheel, the value will stop changing at the specified max value. Unit of Measurement : A unit of measurement can be specified for the integer value. Any plaintext value can be entered and will show up to the field name in parentheses when entering the record. Float Float fields can take in any real numbers as their value. These real numbers can include integers and negative numbers. The advanced field options are exactly the same as the previous section and include: a Default value, a Minimum Value , a Max Value and Unit of Measurement . Default : A default number can be entered into this field. The entered number will always be present in that field when creating a record. This value can be deleted and replaced, but will always be initially present for every record containing this float field . Minimum Value : This specifies the lowest value that can be entered for this field. If a value is entered that is lower than this minimum value, Kora will not accept the minimum value. The record will either not be created, or it will shift to the minimum value. If a user is utilizing arrows or a mouse wheel, the value will stop changing at the specified minimum value. Max Value : This specifies the highest value that can be entered for this field. If a value is entered that is higher than this Max value, Kora will not accept the maximum value. The record will either not be created, or shift to the maximum value. If a user is utilizing arrows or a mouse wheel, the value will stop changing at the specified max value. Unit of Measurement : A unit of measurement can be specified for the float value. Any plaintext value can be entered and will show up to the field name in parentheses when entering the record. List Fields Lists fields allow users to create lists of data or select list options from a controlled vocabulary. Users are also able to generate a list, or create a list of objects associated with other objects. Perhaps the greatest strength of lists is the ability to force users to enter in controlled vocabulary for data fields. Controlled vocabulary refers to the use of a specific terms to refer to your data. If you only have three possible options for a particular value, then that makes it easier to characterize and analyze the data. You don't have to worry about the particular differences in how people describe objects or spelling errors. The trade-off is a loss of nuance. It is up to form creators to decide which goals are important to them. Their are four types of list fields available: list field , multi-select list , generated list and combo list . List A list field is the most straightforward list option available. You may create a list of possible values (a.k.a a controlled vocabulary) from which users may select one value for the data field. A list field will appear as a dropdown menu from which you can select one of these values when creating a record. Many of the options mentioned here are available for all lists and so will refer back to this section. So, when creating any list you may follow these steps in the advanced options to create that list: Under list options, enter your possible values in the green box labeled Type here and hit the enter key or \"ADD\" to add a new list option . From there hit enter or press the \"ADD\" button to add your value to the list. Your new value (\"option 1 in the image below\") will be added to the list options above the green box you entered your data into. You can continue to add values in the bottom green box which will appear in the order created. You may also Copy All List Options or Delete All List Options . Copying list options will put all list options into your clipboard, separated by commas. Deleting all list options will delete all the values you have entered into a list. You will receive a notification asking you to confirm that you really do want to delete all your list options. You are able to move your list options around by clicking on the arrows next to the list options you have created. Clicking on an up arrow will switch that list option with the option below it, while clicking on a down arrow will switch that list option with the option below it. You may also click and drag a list option to a different part of the list. Once you have added all your list options, you are able to save your controlled vocabulary as preset for other lists by pressing the Create a New Value Preset button. You will have to give your list a name and decide if you want forms across your project to be able to use your preset list. You may also select Use a Value Preset for these List Options to select any preset lists that have been created and made available. You may also select from a selection of default preset lists made available across Kora which includes: Boolean, Country, Languages, and U.S States. At the bottom of list options, you will see that you can specify default values for your list. For the list field type, you may only specify one default value. In other multi-select, generated, and combo lists, you are able to specify more than one value. The default value for any list can be changed by the person making the record, but the default value will always be initially chosen when creating a record. Multi-Select List A multi-select list field creates a list of possible values (a.k.a a controlled vocabulary) from which users may select multiple values for the data field. This field follows the same setup as a list field (see steps 1-5 for list field above), but the end result is the ability to select multiple list options from a single list. You may select list options from a multi-select list by clicking them in the drop-down menu. You may also remove selected items by clicking the x * next to the field option. Generated List A generated list enables users to create and edit a list while creating a record. Users enter their own list options as if they were creating their own list field. This means that there are steps to create a generated list in a record, and steps to create a generated list in a form. The process of creating a generated list in a record is outlined in steps 1-3 of the list field section above. Users will enter, delete and rearrange their list options in the same way that list options are created when making a list field. Creating a generated list field in a form provides you with similar advanced options as other lists (steps 1-5 in the list field above), but there are a couple of key differences. First, there is the ability to add a regex expression, which can modify how Kora searches for your field. Secondly, it is important to note that any list options that you add in the advanced options will not show in the generated list that appears when creating a record. That means no default values can be specified or already existing list options added. Users will always have to generate the list from scratch when using a generated list. Combo List A combo list field type allows users to select values from two different field types and associate those values with each other in one list. It is the only list field option that does not follow the steps outlined in the list field above. Instead, follow these steps to create a combo list: In the advanced options of a combo list, you will find the boxes shown in the image below available. The two boxes on the left named Combo List Field Type allow you to select the field types you want for this list. You may select any field type except for File Fields. The boxes on the right named Combo List Field Name allow you to give names to those fields. Here is an example setup in the advanced options. This combo list will use text and date fields to combine the names and birthdays of individuals into a single list. Note that you are unable to edit the advanced options of these individual fields. You Combo List will appear empty when creating a record as shown below. To add paired values to this list, click on the Add New Value button. The individual options for the field types you have selected will be available when adding a new value. In name and birthday example from the previous step, a text field is available for 'Name', while a date field is available for 'Birthday'. Click Create Combo Value to add the desired values to the list. You may add any number of combined values. Date Fields Date fields allow users to enter temporal data when creating records. There are three field types available for these purposes: Date , Date Time and Historical Date . Date The date field allows users to enter a month, day and year. The advanced field options available include: Default month, day and year; Date Format , Start Year , End Year and the ability to specify the current year as the start or end year. Default : a default month, day and/or year can be chosen for the date field type . Default dates are changeable, but will appear initially every time a record using that date field is created. Date Format : use this option to rearrange the order of how the month, date and year appear when making the record. Start Year : this option allows you to specify the earliest year available for users to enter. Users will not be able to enter dates before the start year into records. End Year : this option allows you to specify the latest year that is available for users to enter. Users will not be able to enter dates after this end year into records. Use Current Year as Start Year : if you only want users to be able to enter recent dates, you can select the current year as the start year for dates to be entered. Use Current Year as End Year : if you want users to be able to enter dates up to the current year, select this option to make dates up to this year available. Date Time The date time field type provides everything that the date field type provides, plus time. The Advanced options for a date time field also follow this same logic. Default hour, minutes and seconds are the only advanced option which differ for this field type and they are outlined in the image below. Check out the section on the date field type above to learn more about the other advanced options Default : the date time field type gives the additional option to specify a default hour, minute and second. Default times are changeable, but will appear initially every time a record using that date time field is created. Historical date A historical date field type provides everything that the date field type provides, plus the ability to add prefixes and calendar notation to the dates. The advanced options for this field type are similar to the date time field, except a few advanced options: Select Prefix(Optional) , Select Calendar/Date Notation , Show Prefixes? and Show Calendar/Date Notation? . These advanced options unique to the historical date field type are outlined below. Check out the section on the date field type above to learn more about the other advanced options. Select Prefix(Optional) : prefixes are selected by clicking the circle to the left of their name. The prefixes available include circa, pre and post. Circa refers to approximate or estimated dates. Pre refers to times before the specified date. Post refers to times after the date. You may only select one prefix. Select Calendar/Date Notation : calendar and date notation are selected by clicking the circle to the left of their name. CE refers to common era; BCE refers to before common era, BP refers to before present (oftentimes this means the year 1950 CE); and KYA years often refers to thousands of years before present. You must select one calendar/date notation. Show Prefixes? : If you want your selected prefix to appear when creating and viewing records, then select 'yes' from the drop-down menu. Show Calendar/Date Notation? if you want your selected notation to appear when creating and viewing records then select 'yes' from the drop-down menu. File Fields File Fields allow you to create fields were users can upload files to a record. This includes documents, images, audio, video and 3D models. The image below shows what a typical file field looks like. There will be a title, a space to upload your file, and a description below. The File Field Types are: Documents , Gallery , Playlist , Video and 3D-Model . Documents The documents file field creates a space for document files to be uploaded. Since there are multiple types of files that documents can come in, you must select the document file types that you want to upload. You can customize the types of files you want uploaded and how you want them uploaded with the advanced options available: Max File Size (kb) ; Max File Amount ; and Allowed File Types (MIME): . Max File Size (kb) : allows you to determine the maximum size of a file that can be uploaded. Max File Amount : allows you to determine the maximum number of files that you want uploaded with each record. Allowed File Types (MIME): : this is were you will select the types of files that you want to accept for a document upload. You may want only .pdf or .png files to be uploaded. Due to the wide variety of formats that documents typically come in, no default values are selected for document uploads and there are a wide variety of file types available for selection. This differs from other file fields in because you must choose a document type for it to be possible to upload files. Gallery The gallery file field creates a data field which allows users to upload images. Standard file formats are already selected for this field and include: jpg, gif and png and bmp image files. The advanced options available are similar to other file fields: Max File Size (kb) ; Max File Amount ; and Allowed File Types . Max File Size (kb) : allows you to determine the maximum size of a file that can be uploaded. Max File Amount : allows you to determine the maximum number of files that you want uploaded with each record. Allowed File Types: : the file types provided are already optimized for typical image file formats including: jpg, gif and png and bmp image files. These are the only file types you may choose from. Playlist The playlist file field creates a space for users to upload audio files when making a record. Standard file formats are already selected for this field and include: MP3 and WAV audio files. The advanced options available are similar to other file fields: Max File Size (kb) ; Max File Amount ; and Allowed File Types . Max File Size (kb) : allows you to determine the maximum size of a file that can be uploaded. Max File Amount : allows you to determine the maximum number of files that you want uploaded with each record. Allowed File Types: : the file types provided are already optimized for typical audio file formats including: MP3 and WAV audio files. These are the only file types you may choose from. Video The video file field creates a space for users to upload video files when making a record. There is only one standard file formats selected for this field which is MP4. The advanced options available are similar to other file fields: Max File Size (kb) ; Max File Amount ; and Allowed File Types . Max File Size (kb) : allows you to determine the maximum size of a file that can be uploaded. Max File Amount : allows you to determine the maximum number of files that you want uploaded with each record. Allowed File Types: : the MP4 file type provided is the only file format available for videos. This is the only file types you may choose from. 3D model The 3D model file field creates a space for users to upload 3D models into a record. There are standard file formats already selected for 3D models which include: OBJ, STL, JPEG Texture, PNG Texture and other. The advanced options available are similar to other file fields, but include some notable differences: Max File Size (kb) ; Allowed File Types ; Model Color ; Background Color One ; and Background Color Two . Max File Size (kb) : allows you to determine the maximum size of a file that can be uploaded. Allowed File Types: : the file types provided are already optimized for typical 3D model file formats including: OBJ, STL, JPEG Texture, PNG Texture and other. Model Color : allows you to choose the color of the 3D Model Background Color One : allows you to choose the first background color of the model environment Background Color Two : allows you to choose the second background color of the model environment. Specialty Fields There are a number of different Specialty fields which serve specific functions for form creators. These functions allow users to create true or false options, describe geographic location and associate records with other records. These field types are referred to respectively as: Boolean ; Geolocator ; and Associator fields. Boolean The boolean field allows. As you can see in the previous image, You are able to make a title and description for a boolean field, which the person entering data may check or uncheck by clicking on the circle. You may automatically have the boolean field selected by checking the default option in the advanced options of the boolean field you are creating or editing. Geolocator The geolocator field allows users to enter geographic data through the use of latitude/longitude (lat/long), and address data. When entering new geolocator data, users enter the name of the new location, what type of geographic data they are entering (lat/long or address) and then the actual data. This field provides three advanced options when customizing this field: Default Locations , Map Display and Displayed Data . Default Locations : this advanced field option allows you to enter default locations for a geolocator field. You will enter the location name, location type and data in the same way as a new record. The image below shows the pop-up that appears for entering new locations into a geolocator field. Map Display : This advanced option allows you to display a map with points using entered location data. The points will appear on an interactive map which will automatically zoom to fit all of your points. Viewing records with map display active will show this map when examining records. If map display is inactive then no interactive map will be available for locations entered using Geolocator data. Instead, the raw text for the name of the location, and it's location data will be displayed. Displayed Data : If you choose not to display a map using the Map Display option, then Kora will display your data as text. There are two types of location data that you are able to display when viewing records: Lat Long and Address . Displaying Lat Long will display the coordinates of your location using latitude and longitude coordinates. Likewise, selecting Address will display the address of your locations. If a record provides latitude and longitude, Kora will still be able to look up an associated address to display if that is the option that is chosen. The opposite is also true. Associator An associator field creates connections between records. Let's say, for example, that you want to create a form that keeps track of people associated with a museum project. This could include supervisors, volunteers, archaeologists, etc. Individual records could be created with their names and roles. Now let's say you want to create another form for objects associated with this project. You could create records which include data on these objects and the people involved with the curation of those objects. This could potentially be a lot of data reentry, however. One solution Kora offers for this hypothetical problem is the ability to associate the object records from the one form with the people records from the other form. When an association is created within a record, the associator field displays your selected, associated record as a clickable link within that original record. This link will bring you to the record page for that associated record. The possible association are extremely flexible, in that you are able to associate records with other records from the same form or even records from another project's form. In order to do this, however, you will need to give forms the ability to search each other through Form association permissions . What follows are directions for: creating association permissions between forms; setting up the search configurations for an associator field, and how to use an associator field. Associator Permissions Follow these steps to set up associator permissions: First, you will want to navigate to the desired form that you want to associate other records with. From there you will have to select Association Permissions from either dropdown menu shown below. This will bring you to the Form Associations Page which allows you to grant association access with other forms. If you have administrative access to the forms that you want to associate, select Create a New Form Association . A new box will appear asking you Create a New Form Association . The dropdown menu will initially ask you to select a form. Forms will be displayed here from any project you have access to through a \"project name - form name\" format. Select the form you want to create an association with and click Create a New Form Association . Forms that are allowed to be associated with will be listed at the bottom of the Form Associations Page . If you do not have administrative permissions to a form, you may select the Request Form Access tab. Clicking Request Form Access on that page will allow you to select a form, after which Kora will send an email to all administrators requesting access to form associations. Association Search Configuration Now that you have the correct association permissions set up for your form, you can create an association field that will be able to search records from other forms. In the directions below, we will be creating an associator field that is able to search for records through another form called \"Form 2\". These setup steps will work for any associator field: First go to the advanced options for the associator when creating the field . There you will find the Association Search Configuration , which will have the forms that you are able to search through available to be checked off. Once you have selected the form that you want this field to be able to associate with, you will have the option to select preview values. Preview values will show any values from the selected fields you choose when searching for records. If you do not select a preview value, then the internal Kora Identification (KID) will be the only value that is shown when searching for records with this associator. It is recommended that you choose a field such as \"name\", \"id\", etc. that will allow you to more easily identify what record you are looking at. After your search configuration is set up, you can create a default value for the associator field. Go to the next section for directions on how to use an associator field. How to Use an Associator Field After setting up the permissions and search configurations for an associator field as outlined in the previous sections, you will now be able to associate records from your form with records from other desired forms. Follow these steps to associate records using an associator field: When using an associator field, the first thing you must do is search for a record to associate with. You must search for records by entering key terms or a known KID (Kora Identification number) under Search Associations . In the image below, we search for \"Jane Doe\" Results of your search will show up in the next section labeled Association Results . Results will show up as the KID separated from any preview values you have chosen (step 2 in search configuration). Because we selected a preview value to display a name, we are extra sure that this is the correct record for \"Jane Doe\". Click on the record(s) that you want to appear as associations. Selected association will then appear in the Selected Associations section. You may continue to search for new records to associate by repeating steps 1 & 2. You may also remove selected associations by clicking on the x next to their text.","title":"Understanding Field Types"},{"location":"forms/understanding_field_types/#understanding-field-types","text":"Each form has to ability to add any number of different fields across multiple pages .

This value can be deleted and replaced, but it will be initially present for every record containing this text field . Regex : A Regex pattern allows you to customize how a text field is searched for within Kora. For instance, if a word has multiple ways of being spelled, you can specify the different ways that a text field may be entered: the regular expression seriali[sz]e matches both \"serialise\" and \"serialize\". There are much more complex regex expressions you can learn how to write, however.

First, there is the ability to add a regex expression, which can modify how Kora searches for your field. Secondly, it is important to note that any list options that you add in the advanced options will not show in the generated list that appears when creating a record.

You could create records which include data on these objects and the people involved with the curation of those objects. This could potentially be a lot of data reentry, however. One solution Kora offers for this hypothetical problem is the ability to associate the object records from the one form with the people records from the other form. When an association is created within a record, the associator field displays your selected, associated record as a clickable link within that original record. This link will bring you to the record page for that associated record.

A few things about this guide. First, in many cases of naming something or writing Terminal commands, things will be case sensitive, so unless the specific instance requires uppercase for something, this guide will always use lowercase and its author strongly suggests you do the same. Keeping things all lowercase is a good thing to follow for best practices because it removes any doubt or confusion over whether some file, directory, or URL should have uppercase letters in it. Second, a note about terminology. To keep things consistent, this guide will be using the word \"directory\" and its derivatives throughout this guide, rather than \"folder\" in order to better illuminate the link between URL and file structure throughout this process. Finally, make sure to visit the Kora GitHub repo releases to download the zip file containing the most recent Kora release. Log In to cPanel Begin all of this by logging into your account to reach your cPanel. Most cPanels look something like this: Set up MySQL Database After reaching the cPanel for your server environment, begin by setting up the necessary MySQL Database for your Kora installation. Start by finding the section called \"Databases\" and clicking on \"MySQL Databases\". Under \"Create new Database,\" enter \"kora\" or some other name in the text field and click \"Create Database.\" Take note of the auto-generated prefix, which, when combined with whatever you just provided, will be the name of your MySQL database. In this example case it is called geyerbri_kora . Once you've noted this database name, click on the link to take you back to the previous page. Next, scroll down to \"MySQL Users\" and provide the username \"kora\" in the text box under \"Add New User\". This is a common practice - the database and the default user for that database having the same name - which will make it easier to update configurations elsewhere. After this, click on the button \"Password Generator.\" The Password Generator modal will open and generate a random string of characters (blocked out in the image below). IMPORTANT : Copy this password to somewhere for safe-keeping. You will need it later for configuration of your Kora installation. After copying this password to somewhere, click \"Use Password.\" When the modal closes, the generated password will auto-fill into the \"Add New User\" section and it should rate the password as \"Very Strong.\" Click on \"Create User\" to complete this process. Just as you did with the database name, take note of this username, as you will need it for Kora configuration elsewhere. Because this guide follows the common practice of using the same name for the database and user, this example username is also geyerbri_kora . Click the back link to get back to the previous page. The final step in setting up the required MySQL database is to assign the newly-created user to the newly-created database and give that user full permissions. Do this by first scrolling down to \"Add User To Database\", confirming that the names are correctly chosen, and clicking on \"Add.\" The page that opens will provide a list of permissions that can be assigned to the chosen user for the specified database. Click the checkbox for \"ALL PRIVILEGES.\" Scroll down if needed to find the \"Make Changes\" box. Clicking on it will generate an in-page notification that it was successful. Click on the \"Go Back\" link to get back to the main \"MySQL Databases\" page. To confirm that you have successfully created the database, created the user, and added the user to the database, find the section \"Current Databases\" and check that there is an entry for your new database, with your new user listed as a privileged user. Return to cPanel Main To return from nearly any part of cPanel to the Main interface (shown in the screenshot at the beginning of this guide), you can click on the grid icon in the upper-left. Upload and Prepare Kora Application Files via cPanel File Manager From cPanel Main, find the section \"Files\" and click on \"File Manager.\" Take a note of which directory is your main URL directory (the one that provides all the files available via your main URL). In this screenshot you can see the globe icon being used for the URL directory \"public_html,\" which is the common icon in this version of cPanel and used in MSU's Domain of One's Own. You will also notice the same globe icon, but with a black chain-link icon over it, used for \"www\". This is something different, which will be explained in one of the sections about setting up the installation URL below. But for now just know that the directory with the globe and without the chain-link is the one you need to make note of. In order to properly view all the relevant Kora installation files once they have been created, it is important for you to make all the hidden files visible. To do this, go to the File Manager's \"Settings\" by clicking on the gear icon in the upper-right. Click the checkbox for \"Show Hidden Files (dotfiles)\" and then click \"Save\". Next, you'll upload the kora installation .zip file you downloaded earlier from Kora's GitHub repo releases page. Kora is intended to be installed outside of the main URL directory you noted in Step 2 of this section; the easiest is to install it into the same directory alongside your main URL directory. If you have never changed the default directory that loads when opening File Manager, you are more than likely already viewing the correct location. While at this location, click on \"Upload\" in the menu at the top. In the page that opens, just drag-and-drop the .zip file to upload it. You may also click on \"Select File\" to find it via your computer's file management windows. When the .zip file finishes uploading, click on the link leading back to File Manager. Locate the uploaded .zip file in this directory, right-click it to bring up the context menu, and select \"Extract.\" In the Extract modal that opens, leave the default location alone (the text box is likely blank) and click \"Extract File(s).\" In the follow-up modal called \"Extraction Results,\" click \"Close.\" Extracting the .zip file will create a new directory, which is likely called \"kora-XXX,\" with the version number in the placeholder. Locate this directory, right-click on it, and select \"Rename.\" In the Rename modal that opens, change the text in the box to \"kora\" (without quotations) and click \"Rename File.\" Next, it's time to initially set up the .env file that manages some of the configuration settings for your Kora install. Many of the settings in this file will be adjustable once the installation is complete, but a few are not and require configuration now. Enter your renamed \"kora\" directory, right-click on the \".env.example\" file, and select \"Copy.\" In the Copy modal that opens, add \"/.env\" without quotations to whatever is already in the text box and click \"Copy File(s).\" Once the file has been renamed, select it and then click on \"Edit\" in the menu at the top. The Edit modal that opens provides a warning to back up the file you are about to edit before making any changes. This is always a good practice to follow, so that any mistakes can be quickly and easily rectified. Luckily, since the file you are about to edit is a direct copy of \".env.example,\" you already have a backed-up copy of its current state, so in this case making an additional backup is not necessary. So go ahead and click on \"Edit.\" A new tab will open with the editor. Here, change lines 6, 7, and 8 to match the info you saved about your MySQL database. For example, given the info previously saved from the database setup before, this guide's example code would look like: DB_DATABASE=geyerbri_kora DB_USERNAME=geyerbri_kora DB_PASSWORD={saved database user password} Notice, this is where you will paste in the database password you saved in Step 5 of Set Up MySQL Database above. Remove the curl brackets from the example code and make sure there are no spaces before or after the password. After finishing this, click \"Save Changes\". Once that's done you can either close the tab or click \"Close\" (which does the same thing) and go back to the File Manager tab. Finally, there is one more example file to copy as a configuration file. Enter the directory \"public\" and also copy the file \".htaccess.example\". Add \"/.htaccess\" after the defaulted location, the same way you did for \".env\" in the previous step. The default settings in this file will work for basic installations of Kora, but should you want to adjust settings such as more complex URLs than what this guide presents (see \" Create Kora Installation URLs \"\" below), or to change the advanced settings such as acceptable file sizes, memory limits, timeout lengths, etc., they are controlled in this file. Once copied, you're finished with the initial file setup. Navigate back to cPanel Main. Kora Installation and Further Configuration via cPanel Terminal In cPanel Main, scroll down to the section called \"Advanced\" and open \"Terminal.\" Read and (hopefully) accept the terms to reach the in-cPanel terminal interface. It will look like this: In Terminal, you will be using some basic commands to move around and change a few things. The first one is cd , which just changes your location in the file system. Change your directory to whichever directory you just renamed the extracted zip file to. If you've been using the suggested names above, this will be \"kora\": cd kora Next, run the installation process: php artisan kora:install Before running this last command, the window will look like this: After running, if it is successful, the window will look like this, with the successful installation message (in green): INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT : You must copy the last line generated here in the successful installation message (outlined above), which has your password for the generated username of \"admin\". To copy things in cPanel's Terminal, first use your mouse to select the line, then right-click and select \"Copy.\" Paste this somewhere safe, where you will not lose it! It cannot be stressed enough how important this step is, because losing this password means losing access to your installation. Notice that, in the successful installation message, you are directed to \"give READ access to the web user,\" as well as \"WRITE access\" for specific directories, to ensure that Kora continues functioning properly after users start contributing. What these directions require could be different for different Domain of One's Own environments, because different system administrators may have set up the default permissions for the environment differently. For now, to ensure that things are set up for the most likely scenario for most Domain of One's Own or Reclaim Hosting environments, you will be setting file permissions for the entire \"kora\" directory and its contents. Because these commands have to be applied to all the files and directories within, you will have to do this here, via Terminal, using the chmod command and the -R flag. chmod stands for \"change mode,\" which is how the server's operating system refers to changing permissions. The -R flag tells the command to run recursively, i.e. change them for this directory and everything it contains. Finally, the . is the short-hand for \"my current location.\" This first command is to make sure that any new files and directories created in Kora are assigned the correct permissions in the future. It may not be needed for most cases, but in the few cases where it is, it will be useful. So run the following code: chmod -R g+s . When successful, Terminal will just re-display the command prompt without a message: Next, it is important to confirm that the directories and files in this installation are all set to the 755 permissions level. In the operating system your server is running, this number represents the permissions levels for three different attributes related to a file or directory's ownership in the system. The first number represents the level set for \"Owner,\" the second for \"Group,\" and the third for \"Other/World.\" Setting 7 is full access - aka read, write, and execute - whereas setting 5 is read and execute access only. For the purposes of this basic installation, the level for \"Owner\" should always be set to 7 so that you will always be able to make changes to things if needed. However the amount of access given to \"Group\" and \"Other/World\" attributes will affect the security of your server environment, so it is important to set these to 5 or some other non-write setting whenever possible. So, to confirm that the installation's permissions are set at the appropriate levels for the appropriate attributes, run this command to set all of this directory and its contents to \"READ\" (and execute, which is missing from the successful installation message). Again, in many cases it isn't strictly needed, but in the few where it is this will ensure the settings are set correctly: chmod -R 755 . And just as before, when successful, it will just re-display the command prompt without a message. If you intend to set the \"Write\" privileges because you are sure your specific server environment's defaults will prevent Kora from working properly, then you can prepare for the commands in the next section by changing your location to be one directory above \"Kora\". As before, use cd , but this time use .. , which just means 'move up one directory': cd .. Now your terminal will look like this: Set Write and Execute Privileges On Certain Directories if Needed via cPanel Terminal For some (such as those installing on MSU's Domain of One's Own at the time this documentation was written), the previous commands will have been enough to complete the required permissions setup for their installation. However for others, it will be necessary to specifically change the permissions on the three directory trees noted in the successful installation message. These settings are different because each server environment may have been set up differently by the systems administrator. The install message's reference to \"web user\" is in a way referring to this difference: in some cases, things will be set up such that new files that Kora creates will be attempted to be created with the \"Owner\" attribute/level. In others, the new files will be attempted with the \"Group\" or (in rare cases) \"Other/World\" attribute/level. The specific way your installation works can be tested by quickly creating a record that has a file attached to it, and then uploading that file. If the file upload works, then your current installation does not need any further permissions adjustments. If it does not work, you will need to re-enter cPanel and re-enter Terminal, which should default to the correct location (the directory directly above \"kora\"). You will need to wait until your Kora installation is completed and properly configured before you can properly conduct this test, but its instructions are repeated below in the section \" Test File Permissions \" If the permissions need to be changed, then run the following three commands, using the exact locations described in the successful installation message (reproduced here in case you are coming back to Terminal after learning that your installation requires these settings to work). These will set the \"WRITE\" (and execute) permissions correctly. Hit \"Enter\" after each command (i.e. run each on its own). chmod -R 775 kora/bootstrap/cache/ chmod -R 775 kora/storage/ chmod -R 775 kora/public/assets/javascripts/production/ Just as before, when successful, each of these will just re-display the command prompt without a message. After you've run all three, your terminal will look something like this: Create Kora Installation URLs Next, it is important to have your Kora installation accessible via a web browser and URL. There are two options for doing this: a subdomain or a subdirectory. A subdirectory URL looks like: https://example.org/subdirectory, whereas a subdomain looks like: https://subdomain.example.org. Find the directions for each below. Subdirectory URL Setup Via cPanel Terminal To set up a subdirectory URL for your Kora installation, you will just have to do a couple more things in Terminal. First you will change your location to be inside of the directory that your main URL is accessible from: in this example case in MSU's Domain of One's Own environment, this is a directory called public_html . But another common case is www . Use: cd public_html Note: if you receive an error that \"public_html\" does not exist, more than likely this is because you skipped over a few previous steps that did not pertain to you and so you are currently still inside of the \"kora\" directory. If this is the case, use cd .. to move upward, and then again try cd public_html . Setting up the subdirectory for your URL requires using the command ln with the -s flag. ln stands for \"link\" and the -s flag tells the system that the link being created is \"symbolic\". The next part of the command is the location of the Kora installation public directory, relative to your current location. And then the final part is the location of the desired subdirectory that will appear at the end of your site's URL. So in the case of a public_html example, the public directory of the installation files is located one directory up, and then inside of kora . So the command is: ln -s ../kora/public kora After both of these steps, your terminal window will look something like this: This was the last bit of Terminal required for setup, so you may now close Terminal and return to cPanel Main. To confirm that the symbolic link process worked, you may go back into File Manager and navigate into your publicly-accessible directory. There, you should find the directory \"kora\" with the black chain-link icon over the folder icon. Subdomain URLs If going this route for your URL, you can now close Terminal and return to cPanel Main. Setting up the subdomain option for your URL requires using the \"Subdomains\" tool in cPanel, under the \"Domains\" section. In the Subdomain text box, type what you would like for your URL to begin with, before your site's main URL (remember the example above: https://subdomain.example.org). The selected \"Domain\" will likely default to your main URL, which is correct (in the case where you have multiple URLs available, choose the appropriate one). And the tool will autogenerate content in the \"Document Root\" box after you enter something in the \"Subdomain\" box; delete this autogenerated content and instead enter the directory tree for the public folder of your Kora installation. If you have been using all the same directory names and locations as this guide, then you will enter \"kora/public\" into this box. Then hit create. You can see all of this in this screenshot: Enable Force HTTPS for URL Once you have implemented one of the two methods above, your Kora installation is now reachable via a web browser! But there is one last task you should complete before doing so. Kora is designed to use HTTPS protocol for its URLs. So it is important to set up a Force HTTPS Redirect for your domain, and for the subdomain as well if you have gone that route for your URL. To do this, go to \"Domains\" under the \"Domains\" section in cPanel. For your main domain entry and subdomain entry on the list, click the toggle to turn it on (or ensure it is already toggled on for each). Once completed, return to cPanel Main. Further Configure Kora Once installed In a new tab, navigate to your Kora application's URL. If everything has been done correctly, you should land on the login page for your Kora installation. But keep the cPanel open in another tab because you will need to switch back to it to set up your email at some point. If you successfully reached the Kora login page, Congratulations! Your install is at least partially working! From here you will log into the admin account in order to configure your installation properly, but also to test that your directory permissions settings are working properly. The username is \"admin\" and the password is the one that you copied from Terminal, from the successful installation message. Put in that password to log in and you will land on a page that looks like this: It is highly recommended that you at some point click through the introduction to get a quick tutorial on the basics of using Kora. Once done, click on the menu icon in the top-right to bring out the side-bar menu. Then click on \"Management\" at the bottom and select \"Kora Configuration File\" from the options that appear. This page provides text fields to update much of the information saved in that .env file you briefly edited back in Step 8 of \" Upload and Prepare Kora Application Files via cPanel File Manager .\" Configure reCAPTCHA NOTE : Because this subsection regards setting up an external service, there are no screenshots provided. Kora currently uses reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox Kora uses Google's reCAPTCHA service for anti-robot protections. As you can see on the screenshot above, the configuration file is asking for a \"Recaptcha Private Key\" and \"Recaptcha Public Key\", which you will get from that service. The reCAPTCHA documentation can be found at https://developers.google.com/recaptcha , but to create the keys needed for your site, you will go to https://www.google.com/u/0/recaptcha/admin/ . Google will ask you to log in with a Gmail account. Many academic institutions have contracts with Google for using their tools via an educational arrangement; in the case of MSU, it is possible to give Google's login page an MSU email address, which then redirects to an MSU-related login page. Successfully logging in redirects back to reCAPTCHA under the MSU account. If this option is not available to you, unfortunately you will need a Gmail account to gain access to reCAPTCHA, which is required for completing Kora's installation setup. Once logged in, click on the plus icon in the upper-right to register a new site. Give it any label you prefer (a suggestion would be to use your Kora installation URL). As noted above, Kora currently uses reCAPTCHA v2 \"I'm not a robot\" Checkbox version, so pick those options. Under \"Domains\", write your main domain (do not include the subdomain or subdirectory) and either hit Enter or click the plus sign to add it to the list of approved domains for the set of keys that are about to be generated. As an aside: this functionality means you could conceivably have multiple Kora installations, or even multiple sites that use reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox, all using the same keys. The \"Owners\" section should auto-add your account email, but you can add another if you wish. Be sure to (review and) accept the Terms of Service. The final option is the checkbox for \"Send alerts to owners\", which you may wish to leave enabled so that you receive emailed updates when security issues with your site arise. Finally, click \"Submit\". Once redirected back to the main page, the lighter-blue bar at the top will display the number of sites registered and have a dropdown list for you to select whichever. Obviously if this is the first time setting one up, you will only have one. Ensure the one you intend to use is selected in the dropdown and then click on the gear icon in the upper right to go to the reCAPTCHA \"Settings\" page. Click on the \"reCAPTCHA keys\" dropdown list to display your site and secret keys. Copy the \"site key\" and paste it into your Kora Configuration File page text box titled \"Recaptcha Public Key\"; copy the \"secret key\" and paste it into the text box titled \"Recaptcha Private Key\". If you want to ensure this information is saved before setting up your email, scroll to the bottom of the page and click \"Update Configuration File\". Set Up Server Email and Link It to kora To set up mail for your Kora install, this guide will explain how to use the email client available through cPanel for your Domain of One's Own account. It is possible to set this up with other email clients, however this basic option is easiest for keeping the installation and email all under the one environment. Return to your tab with cPanel Main. Find \"Email Accounts\" under the \"Email\" section. To set up a kora-specific email address, click on \"Create\". (You could also use the default email address that has already been generated if you like; if using the default email, skip to Step 4 below.) In the \"Create an Email Account\" box, look at the options available in the \"Domain\" dropdown menu. This will be the portion of the email address after the @ symbol. If using a subdomain URL, you can specify this subdomain here, otherwise your option will be limited to your main URL. After choosing the domain, enter a \"Username\", such as \"admin\" if you use the subdomain option, or \"kora\" if you use the main URL option. Finally, click on Generate in the \"Password\" section to receive a randomly generated password (as you did when setting up your MySQL database). IMPORTANT : Just as before, ensure you copy this password and save it someplace safe, because it will be needed for email configuration in Kora. The remaining settings should be set according to your preferences. I will not outline how to link this email account to a mail client because the option to generate an email with just such a guide is provided by cPanel. Once everything is set as you like, click \"Create\", which, as long as you leave the \"Stay on this page...\" option unchecked, will create the address and redirect you back to the list of email addresses. To confirm that your address is working properly, click on \"Check Mail\" next to your new address in the list. Then click \"Open\" on the resulting page. As long as these pages load correctly, your server's email client is working correctly. If they do not - for instance, MSU's Domain of One's Own accounts currently are not working - you must contact the administrators of your server to rectify this. Return to your Kora Configuration File page tab. Scrolling down, you will find the text boxes for your email information. Leave \"Mail Host\" with \"localhost\". For \"Mail From Address\", it is best to enter the email address you just created so that the emails user receive appear to come from that account; in this example, \"admin@kora.geyerbri.msu.domains\". Set the \"Mail From Name\" to your own preference, such as \"Kora Admin\". The \"Mail User\" setting is how Kora connects with your server's mail client, to actually send the email. So this one must be set to an appropriately-configured email, such as the one just created; in this example, \"admin@kora.geyerbri.msu.domains\" again. Finally, paste in the save email password into the last box, \"Mail Password\". Save all of these configurations by clicking \"Update Configuration File\". See all of these settings in this screenshot: Admin User Profile settings The final portion of configuration is for the admin account's profile settings. This section is specific to what is a part of the initial configuration for Kora, but this documentation website also has a more complete guide for user profile settings . To get there to the profile settings page, select the user icon in the upper-right. Then choose \"Edit My Profile.\" On this page, you can change the username and password that were auto-generated when installing Kora in Terminal, however it is probably best to leave these alone. However, it is important to change the default admin email here because it is shown to users at various locations throughout Kora. Change it to either your own professional email address, or if you plan to check the server email account set up before (either through the interface you loaded before, or by forwarding it to an email client), set it to that address. You can also change the displayed admin name, if you wish, as it is also displayed to users in various locations. Finally, should you wish to change the admin account password from what was auto-generated to one you prefer, you can do that here. Once all these have been set, click \"Update Profile\" to complete your setup. Test File permissions As noted above in the section above outlining how to set the Write and Execute privileges for the specified directories, in some cases Kora will not work with the defaulted permissions generated during installation. To check whether or not your installation works properly: Create a Project . Create a Form in that project. Create a Field in that project with the field type set to one of the File types (setting it to \"Documents\" will give the greatest flexibility for uploading any file to test). And finally, create a Record where you upload an example file. If the creation of that Record with an uploaded file succeeds, such that the uploaded file is viewable or downloadable when clicked upon, then your permissions are correct. If this fails, please go to Set Write and Execute Privileges On Certain Directories if Needed via cPanel Terminal above. Follow the instructions there for using cPanel Terminal to adjust your Kora installation's permissions on the correct directories.","title":"Installing Kora on Domain of One's Own & Reclaim Hosting"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#installing-kora-on-domain-of-ones-own-and-reclaim-hosting","text":"This is a basic guide for installing Kora in a Reclaim Hosting -based server environment, which includes any Domain of One's Own services offered by institutions. A few things about this guide. First, in many cases of naming something or writing Terminal commands, things will be case sensitive, so unless the specific instance requires uppercase for something, this guide will always use lowercase and its author strongly suggests you do the same. Keeping things all lowercase is a good thing to follow for best practices because it removes any doubt or confusion over whether some file, directory, or URL should have uppercase letters in it. Second, a note about terminology. To keep things consistent, this guide will be using the word \"directory\" and its derivatives throughout this guide, rather than \"folder\" in order to better illuminate the link between URL and file structure throughout this process. Finally, make sure to visit the Kora GitHub repo releases to download the zip file containing the most recent Kora release.","title":"Installing Kora on Domain of One's Own and Reclaim Hosting"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#log-in-to-cpanel","text":"Begin all of this by logging into your account to reach your cPanel. Most cPanels look something like this:","title":"Log In to cPanel"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#set-up-mysql-database","text":"After reaching the cPanel for your server environment, begin by setting up the necessary MySQL Database for your Kora installation. Start by finding the section called \"Databases\" and clicking on \"MySQL Databases\". Under \"Create new Database,\" enter \"kora\" or some other name in the text field and click \"Create Database.\" Take note of the auto-generated prefix, which, when combined with whatever you just provided, will be the name of your MySQL database. In this example case it is called geyerbri_kora . Once you've noted this database name, click on the link to take you back to the previous page. Next, scroll down to \"MySQL Users\" and provide the username \"kora\" in the text box under \"Add New User\". This is a common practice - the database and the default user for that database having the same name - which will make it easier to update configurations elsewhere. After this, click on the button \"Password Generator.\" The Password Generator modal will open and generate a random string of characters (blocked out in the image below). IMPORTANT : Copy this password to somewhere for safe-keeping. You will need it later for configuration of your Kora installation. After copying this password to somewhere, click \"Use Password.\" When the modal closes, the generated password will auto-fill into the \"Add New User\" section and it should rate the password as \"Very Strong.\" Click on \"Create User\" to complete this process. Just as you did with the database name, take note of this username, as you will need it for Kora configuration elsewhere. Because this guide follows the common practice of using the same name for the database and user, this example username is also geyerbri_kora . Click the back link to get back to the previous page. The final step in setting up the required MySQL database is to assign the newly-created user to the newly-created database and give that user full permissions. Do this by first scrolling down to \"Add User To Database\", confirming that the names are correctly chosen, and clicking on \"Add.\" The page that opens will provide a list of permissions that can be assigned to the chosen user for the specified database. Click the checkbox for \"ALL PRIVILEGES.\" Scroll down if needed to find the \"Make Changes\" box. Clicking on it will generate an in-page notification that it was successful. Click on the \"Go Back\" link to get back to the main \"MySQL Databases\" page. To confirm that you have successfully created the database, created the user, and added the user to the database, find the section \"Current Databases\" and check that there is an entry for your new database, with your new user listed as a privileged user.","title":"Set up MySQL Database"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#return-to-cpanel-main","text":"To return from nearly any part of cPanel to the Main interface (shown in the screenshot at the beginning of this guide), you can click on the grid icon in the upper-left.","title":"Return to cPanel Main"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#upload-and-prepare-kora-application-files-via-cpanel-file-manager","text":"From cPanel Main, find the section \"Files\" and click on \"File Manager.\" Take a note of which directory is your main URL directory (the one that provides all the files available via your main URL). In this screenshot you can see the globe icon being used for the URL directory \"public_html,\" which is the common icon in this version of cPanel and used in MSU's Domain of One's Own. You will also notice the same globe icon, but with a black chain-link icon over it, used for \"www\". This is something different, which will be explained in one of the sections about setting up the installation URL below. But for now just know that the directory with the globe and without the chain-link is the one you need to make note of. In order to properly view all the relevant Kora installation files once they have been created, it is important for you to make all the hidden files visible. To do this, go to the File Manager's \"Settings\" by clicking on the gear icon in the upper-right. Click the checkbox for \"Show Hidden Files (dotfiles)\" and then click \"Save\". Next, you'll upload the kora installation .zip file you downloaded earlier from Kora's GitHub repo releases page. Kora is intended to be installed outside of the main URL directory you noted in Step 2 of this section; the easiest is to install it into the same directory alongside your main URL directory. If you have never changed the default directory that loads when opening File Manager, you are more than likely already viewing the correct location. While at this location, click on \"Upload\" in the menu at the top. In the page that opens, just drag-and-drop the .zip file to upload it. You may also click on \"Select File\" to find it via your computer's file management windows. When the .zip file finishes uploading, click on the link leading back to File Manager. Locate the uploaded .zip file in this directory, right-click it to bring up the context menu, and select \"Extract.\" In the Extract modal that opens, leave the default location alone (the text box is likely blank) and click \"Extract File(s).\" In the follow-up modal called \"Extraction Results,\" click \"Close.\" Extracting the .zip file will create a new directory, which is likely called \"kora-XXX,\" with the version number in the placeholder. Locate this directory, right-click on it, and select \"Rename.\" In the Rename modal that opens, change the text in the box to \"kora\" (without quotations) and click \"Rename File.\" Next, it's time to initially set up the .env file that manages some of the configuration settings for your Kora install. Many of the settings in this file will be adjustable once the installation is complete, but a few are not and require configuration now. Enter your renamed \"kora\" directory, right-click on the \".env.example\" file, and select \"Copy.\" In the Copy modal that opens, add \"/.env\" without quotations to whatever is already in the text box and click \"Copy File(s).\" Once the file has been renamed, select it and then click on \"Edit\" in the menu at the top. The Edit modal that opens provides a warning to back up the file you are about to edit before making any changes. This is always a good practice to follow, so that any mistakes can be quickly and easily rectified. Luckily, since the file you are about to edit is a direct copy of \".env.example,\" you already have a backed-up copy of its current state, so in this case making an additional backup is not necessary. So go ahead and click on \"Edit.\" A new tab will open with the editor. Here, change lines 6, 7, and 8 to match the info you saved about your MySQL database. For example, given the info previously saved from the database setup before, this guide's example code would look like: DB_DATABASE=geyerbri_kora DB_USERNAME=geyerbri_kora DB_PASSWORD={saved database user password} Notice, this is where you will paste in the database password you saved in Step 5 of Set Up MySQL Database above. Remove the curl brackets from the example code and make sure there are no spaces before or after the password. After finishing this, click \"Save Changes\". Once that's done you can either close the tab or click \"Close\" (which does the same thing) and go back to the File Manager tab. Finally, there is one more example file to copy as a configuration file. Enter the directory \"public\" and also copy the file \".htaccess.example\". Add \"/.htaccess\" after the defaulted location, the same way you did for \".env\" in the previous step. The default settings in this file will work for basic installations of Kora, but should you want to adjust settings such as more complex URLs than what this guide presents (see \" Create Kora Installation URLs \"\" below), or to change the advanced settings such as acceptable file sizes, memory limits, timeout lengths, etc., they are controlled in this file. Once copied, you're finished with the initial file setup. Navigate back to cPanel Main.","title":"Upload and Prepare Kora Application Files via cPanel File Manager"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#kora-installation-and-further-configuration-via-cpanel-terminal","text":"In cPanel Main, scroll down to the section called \"Advanced\" and open \"Terminal.\" Read and (hopefully) accept the terms to reach the in-cPanel terminal interface. It will look like this: In Terminal, you will be using some basic commands to move around and change a few things. The first one is cd , which just changes your location in the file system. Change your directory to whichever directory you just renamed the extracted zip file to. If you've been using the suggested names above, this will be \"kora\": cd kora Next, run the installation process: php artisan kora:install Before running this last command, the window will look like this: After running, if it is successful, the window will look like this, with the successful installation message (in green): INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT : You must copy the last line generated here in the successful installation message (outlined above), which has your password for the generated username of \"admin\". To copy things in cPanel's Terminal, first use your mouse to select the line, then right-click and select \"Copy.\" Paste this somewhere safe, where you will not lose it! It cannot be stressed enough how important this step is, because losing this password means losing access to your installation. Notice that, in the successful installation message, you are directed to \"give READ access to the web user,\" as well as \"WRITE access\" for specific directories, to ensure that Kora continues functioning properly after users start contributing. What these directions require could be different for different Domain of One's Own environments, because different system administrators may have set up the default permissions for the environment differently. For now, to ensure that things are set up for the most likely scenario for most Domain of One's Own or Reclaim Hosting environments, you will be setting file permissions for the entire \"kora\" directory and its contents. Because these commands have to be applied to all the files and directories within, you will have to do this here, via Terminal, using the chmod command and the -R flag. chmod stands for \"change mode,\" which is how the server's operating system refers to changing permissions. The -R flag tells the command to run recursively, i.e. change them for this directory and everything it contains. Finally, the . is the short-hand for \"my current location.\" This first command is to make sure that any new files and directories created in Kora are assigned the correct permissions in the future. It may not be needed for most cases, but in the few cases where it is, it will be useful. So run the following code: chmod -R g+s . When successful, Terminal will just re-display the command prompt without a message: Next, it is important to confirm that the directories and files in this installation are all set to the 755 permissions level. In the operating system your server is running, this number represents the permissions levels for three different attributes related to a file or directory's ownership in the system. The first number represents the level set for \"Owner,\" the second for \"Group,\" and the third for \"Other/World.\" Setting 7 is full access - aka read, write, and execute - whereas setting 5 is read and execute access only. For the purposes of this basic installation, the level for \"Owner\" should always be set to 7 so that you will always be able to make changes to things if needed. However the amount of access given to \"Group\" and \"Other/World\" attributes will affect the security of your server environment, so it is important to set these to 5 or some other non-write setting whenever possible. So, to confirm that the installation's permissions are set at the appropriate levels for the appropriate attributes, run this command to set all of this directory and its contents to \"READ\" (and execute, which is missing from the successful installation message). Again, in many cases it isn't strictly needed, but in the few where it is this will ensure the settings are set correctly: chmod -R 755 . And just as before, when successful, it will just re-display the command prompt without a message. If you intend to set the \"Write\" privileges because you are sure your specific server environment's defaults will prevent Kora from working properly, then you can prepare for the commands in the next section by changing your location to be one directory above \"Kora\". As before, use cd , but this time use .. , which just means 'move up one directory': cd .. Now your terminal will look like this:","title":"Kora Installation and Further Configuration via cPanel Terminal"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#set-write-and-execute-privileges-on-certain-directories-if-needed-via-cpanel-terminal","text":"For some (such as those installing on MSU's Domain of One's Own at the time this documentation was written), the previous commands will have been enough to complete the required permissions setup for their installation. However for others, it will be necessary to specifically change the permissions on the three directory trees noted in the successful installation message. These settings are different because each server environment may have been set up differently by the systems administrator. The install message's reference to \"web user\" is in a way referring to this difference: in some cases, things will be set up such that new files that Kora creates will be attempted to be created with the \"Owner\" attribute/level. In others, the new files will be attempted with the \"Group\" or (in rare cases) \"Other/World\" attribute/level. The specific way your installation works can be tested by quickly creating a record that has a file attached to it, and then uploading that file. If the file upload works, then your current installation does not need any further permissions adjustments. If it does not work, you will need to re-enter cPanel and re-enter Terminal, which should default to the correct location (the directory directly above \"kora\"). You will need to wait until your Kora installation is completed and properly configured before you can properly conduct this test, but its instructions are repeated below in the section \" Test File Permissions \" If the permissions need to be changed, then run the following three commands, using the exact locations described in the successful installation message (reproduced here in case you are coming back to Terminal after learning that your installation requires these settings to work). These will set the \"WRITE\" (and execute) permissions correctly. Hit \"Enter\" after each command (i.e. run each on its own). chmod -R 775 kora/bootstrap/cache/ chmod -R 775 kora/storage/ chmod -R 775 kora/public/assets/javascripts/production/ Just as before, when successful, each of these will just re-display the command prompt without a message. After you've run all three, your terminal will look something like this:","title":"Set Write and Execute Privileges On Certain Directories if Needed via cPanel Terminal"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#create-kora-installation-urls","text":"Next, it is important to have your Kora installation accessible via a web browser and URL.

Find the directions for each below.","title":"Create Kora Installation URLs"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#subdirectory-url-setup-via-cpanel-terminal","text":"To set up a subdirectory URL for your Kora installation, you will just have to do a couple more things in Terminal. First you will change your location to be inside of the directory that your main URL is accessible from: in this example case in MSU's Domain of One's Own environment, this is a directory called public_html . But another common case is www . Use: cd public_html Note: if you receive an error that \"public_html\" does not exist, more than likely this is because you skipped over a few previous steps that did not pertain to you and so you are currently still inside of the \"kora\" directory. If this is the case, use cd .. to move upward, and then again try cd public_html . Setting up the subdirectory for your URL requires using the command ln with the -s flag. ln stands for \"link\" and the -s flag tells the system that the link being created is \"symbolic\". The next part of the command is the location of the Kora installation public directory, relative to your current location. And then the final part is the location of the desired subdirectory that will appear at the end of your site's URL. So in the case of a public_html example, the public directory of the installation files is located one directory up, and then inside of kora . So the command is: ln -s ../kora/public kora After both of these steps, your terminal window will look something like this: This was the last bit of Terminal required for setup, so you may now close Terminal and return to cPanel Main.

As noted above, Kora currently uses reCAPTCHA v2 \"I'm not a robot\" Checkbox version, so pick those options. Under \"Domains\", write your main domain (do not include the subdomain or subdirectory) and either hit Enter or click the plus sign to add it to the list of approved domains for the set of keys that are about to be generated. As an aside: this functionality means you could conceivably have multiple Kora installations, or even multiple sites that use reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox, all using the same keys. The \"Owners\" section should auto-add your account email, but you can add another if you wish. Be sure to (review and) accept the Terms of Service. The final option is the checkbox for \"Send alerts to owners\", which you may wish to leave enabled so that you receive emailed updates when security issues with your site arise. Finally, click \"Submit\". Once redirected back to the main page, the lighter-blue bar at the top will display the number of sites registered and have a dropdown list for you to select whichever. Obviously if this is the first time setting one up, you will only have one. Ensure the one you intend to use is selected in the dropdown and then click on the gear icon in the upper right to go to the reCAPTCHA \"Settings\" page. Click on the \"reCAPTCHA keys\" dropdown list to display your site and secret keys. Copy the \"site key\" and paste it into your Kora Configuration File page text box titled \"Recaptcha Public Key\"; copy the \"secret key\" and paste it into the text box titled \"Recaptcha Private Key\". If you want to ensure this information is saved before setting up your email, scroll to the bottom of the page and click \"Update Configuration File\".","title":"Configure reCAPTCHA"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#set-up-server-email-and-link-it-to-kora","text":"To set up mail for your Kora install, this guide will explain how to use the email client available through cPanel for your Domain of One's Own account. It is possible to set this up with other email clients, however this basic option is easiest for keeping the installation and email all under the one environment. Return to your tab with cPanel Main. Find \"Email Accounts\" under the \"Email\" section. To set up a kora-specific email address, click on \"Create\". (You could also use the default email address that has already been generated if you like; if using the default email, skip to Step 4 below.) In the \"Create an Email Account\" box, look at the options available in the \"Domain\" dropdown menu. This will be the portion of the email address after the @ symbol. If using a subdomain URL, you can specify this subdomain here, otherwise your option will be limited to your main URL. After choosing the domain, enter a \"Username\", such as \"admin\" if you use the subdomain option, or \"kora\" if you use the main URL option. Finally, click on Generate in the \"Password\" section to receive a randomly generated password (as you did when setting up your MySQL database). IMPORTANT : Just as before, ensure you copy this password and save it someplace safe, because it will be needed for email configuration in Kora. The remaining settings should be set according to your preferences. I will not outline how to link this email account to a mail client because the option to generate an email with just such a guide is provided by cPanel. Once everything is set as you like, click \"Create\", which, as long as you leave the \"Stay on this page...\" option unchecked, will create the address and redirect you back to the list of email addresses. To confirm that your address is working properly, click on \"Check Mail\" next to your new address in the list. Then click \"Open\" on the resulting page. As long as these pages load correctly, your server's email client is working correctly. If they do not - for instance, MSU's Domain of One's Own accounts currently are not working - you must contact the administrators of your server to rectify this. Return to your Kora Configuration File page tab. Scrolling down, you will find the text boxes for your email information. Leave \"Mail Host\" with \"localhost\". For \"Mail From Address\", it is best to enter the email address you just created so that the emails user receive appear to come from that account; in this example, \"admin@kora.geyerbri.msu.domains\". Set the \"Mail From Name\" to your own preference, such as \"Kora Admin\". The \"Mail User\" setting is how Kora connects with your server's mail client, to actually send the email. So this one must be set to an appropriately-configured email, such as the one just created; in this example, \"admin@kora.geyerbri.msu.domains\" again. Finally, paste in the save email password into the last box, \"Mail Password\". Save all of these configurations by clicking \"Update Configuration File\". See all of these settings in this screenshot:","title":"Set Up Server Email and Link It to kora"},{"location":"getting-started/installing_kora_domains/#admin-user-profile-settings","text":"The final portion of configuration is for the admin account's profile settings.

To get there to the profile settings page, select the user icon in the upper-right. Then choose \"Edit My Profile.\" On this page, you can change the username and password that were auto-generated when installing Kora in Terminal, however it is probably best to leave these alone. However, it is important to change the default admin email here because it is shown to users at various locations throughout Kora. Change it to either your own professional email address, or if you plan to check the server email account set up before (either through the interface you loaded before, or by forwarding it to an email client), set it to that address. You can also change the displayed admin name, if you wish, as it is also displayed to users in various locations. Finally, should you wish to change the admin account password from what was auto-generated to one you prefer, you can do that here.

Kora takes a somewhat unique approach to user types and permissions. Instead of having a variety of user types, each with their own fixed array of permissions, Kora (mostly) uses a group model. Basically, a permission group in Kora is a bucket to which a Kora admin assigns permissions (called group permissions). Any user can be placed in a permission group, thereby inhereting the permissions of the group. The point of this model is to provide maximum flexibility for user management. A Kora admin could create a permission group that only allows users to view records, while another permission group could allow users to view and edit records. There are two types of permission groups: Project Groups and Form Groups . Each group type has slighlty different options (more on that below) given that what you can do in a Kora project is different from what you can do in a Kora form. Beyond permission groups, there are three fixed user types: Kora Admin , Project Admin , and Form Admin . Kora Admin A Kora admin sits on top of the user pyramid. They have access to all projects in a Kora install, and have unique management privaledges such as: creating, editing, deleting projects; importing and exporting projects; configuring a Kora install; managing all users in a Kora install; and managing Kora tokens and API requests. In addition, they have all of the privaledges of all other user types and permission groups. Basically, a Kora admin can do anythign in a Kora install. While all new Kora installs require at least one admin, you (as an admin) can create any number of other admin accounts. Project Admin Similar to the Kora Admin, the Project Admin sits at the top of the user pyramid within a project . While they can't create new projects, they pretty much can do anything within the project for which they are an admin. This includes creating forms, editing forms, deleting forms, creating field value presets, importing and exporting forms, and managing user permissions. They also have the permissions of all of the user and permission groups below them. Form Admin Similar to Kora Admins and Peoject Admins, a Form Admin is the top level user within a form . While they can't create new forms, they have pretty much all other permissions within the form for which they are an admin. This includes managing form permissions, managing associator permissions (managing what forms are alowed to associte to other forms), importing and export records, delete records, delete all records, delete old record files (deleting files that belong to a reord that no longer exists), managing record presets, managing revisions, creating and editing fields, creating and editing records, deleting records, and modifying form layouts. Project Group As their name suggests, Project Groups exist on the project level, and control permissions of users within a single project. Project groups have three options that can be turned on or off: Create Forms, Edit Forms, Delete Forms. By default, when a new project is created in Kora, there are two permission groups: Admin Group and Default Group . The Admin Group has all three abovementioned options turned on. The Default Group, on the other hand, doesn't have any of the options turned on. Project Admins can, of course, change the options for the two default permission groups, or create any number of new ones they want. Need to learn how to add/remove users within a project? Visit the Adding Users to Projects guide. Form Groups As their name suggests, Form Groups exist on the form level. They control the permissions of users within a single form. Form Groups have 6 options that can be turned on or off: Create Field, Edit Field, Delete Field, Create Record, Edit Record, and Delete Record. When a new form is created, two default permission groups are created: Admin Group and Default Group. The Admin Group has all of the aforementioned options turned on, while the Default has all of them turned off. A Form Admin (or a Project Admin or Kora Admin, for that matter) can modify these as they see fit, or create any number of new Form Groups as they need.

How you search for a record will depend on how narrow you want your search parameters to be. You can cast a wide net and search for a record across an entire Kora installation, or you can look in a specific project. There were also be many cases where you want to look at all of the records from a single form. This documentation will walk you through the steps of conducting each type of these searches. Searching Across a Kora Installation At the navigation bar at the top of the page, is a magnifying glass icon. No matter what page you are on, this navigation bar and icon should be available. clicking on it will allow you to search for any records within the Kora Installation that you have access to. Follow these steps to search for a form using this method: Click on the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner within the navigation bar. A search bar will appear which will allow you to enter search terms associated with the record you are searching for. If you are able to enter the KID of your record, the option to Go to Record: will be made available under the search bar. Simply click on the record number to go to that record. The record number must be entered exactly to bring up this option. However, you may not know the exact KID of your record, in that case, you will have to enter keywords and data into the search bar that might be associated with that record and click the right-facing arrow in the search bar to perform a proper search. This search will examine records, forms, fields and projects for any results which may match your search. Kora will then display these results on the Search Kora page. Any records matching your search will be found in the Records() tab for you to browse. You can conduct another search using the Search Via Keyword(s) or KID box near the upper part of the page. Your new search can be filtered by selecting \u201cOr,\u201d \u201cAnd,\u201d or \u201cKID\u201d. The record search will automatically start off by searching through all projects, but it's possible to search through particular project by selecting them from the Search and Select Projects(s) to Filter Results box. Searching for a Record within a Project You can greatly narrow down the number of records you search through if you know what project a record may be in.
