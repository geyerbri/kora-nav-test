# KORA DOCUMENTATION


## Contributing

For typos, deadlinks, missing images, and other minor matters, please file an issue against this repository. 

Additions and significant changes should be created in a branch and submitted as a pull request. Please take the following into consideration when writing documentation:

- This is documentation for ordinary users, not developers. Please use clear, jargon-free language. 
- Explain every possible step, even the ones which seem obvious. It is better for users to skip a step they've already completed than be confused by a leap they can't follow. Do not assume any prior knowledge of technology on the part of the user for this documentation.
- Break longer tasks up into short paragraphs or lists.
- Use illustrative images when needed, especially to indicate which button or link users should engage with.

### Formatting 
**Section headings** should start with H2 (`##`) and go down to H4. Create sections where it is logical in the documentation structure; they will appear in the left navigation of the documentation (see [\example]\ for an example of extensive section use)
  
**Links** should be composed as relative to the current file. 
 
**Images** for a file go into the `files` directory of the directory in which the file sits (so, for content files, images go into the `contentimages` directory).
